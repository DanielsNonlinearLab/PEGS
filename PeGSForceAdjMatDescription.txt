joForceAdjMat
post-process the disk solver data and compute adjacency matrices and some statistics 

1. User defined parameters

- which files are we processing ?
- in which directory are these files
- fmin: minimum force (in Newton) to consider a contact a valid contact
- fmax: maximum force (in Newton) to consider a contact a valid contact
- emax: maximum fit error/residual to consider a contact a valid contact
- verbose: make lots of plots as we go
- (optional) coordinate system transformation (i.e. if you processed only part of an image)

2. Program

- for all specified files
- read the solved file
- read the original force image
- generate a synthetic version of the force image from the solved data
- build a list of contacts
	* check if contact is valid by comparing to fmin, fmax & emax
	* compute normal and tangential force from fabs and alpha
	* add the contact to the adjacency matrix
	* plot contact lines on top of orignal image

- write the synthetic image to disc
- write the contact line overlay image to disc
- write the adjacency matrix to disc
